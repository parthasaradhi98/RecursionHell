DONT CLONE THIS REPO. Create a fork of this repo and add your personal github as creator. Then go to your personal github and clone it from there. Any changes you push should be to your personal github. You can sync your personal repo with this master one, and also contribute by raising a pull request from your repo to this master repo.

I fixed the issue with legacy peers and peer dependencies. Simple npm run SHOULD work. DONT HAVE TO RUN INSTALL WITH --leagacy-peer.

Setup:
npm install
npm start

If adding a new library:
npm install --save
